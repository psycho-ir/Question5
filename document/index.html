</h3>

<p>
    First of all we need to find all categories of P30Download. category_finder.CategoryCrawler class is responsible to find all categories and
    select one of them randomly. Also this class sanitizes categories to remove not category links which are in navbar.
</p>

<h3>
    links_finder
</h3>

<p>
    link_finder module is responsible for find post links from category link. Every category page has some posts in some pages (Maybe the number of posts are less than the
    expected number of posts. In the other hand all posts are not in a page so we need to navigate to different pages of category to find the expected number of posts.
    links_finder.PostLinkCrawler finds some pages which are required to gather links. _find_page_links is responsible to find all post links which are the given page.
</p>

<h2>

    post_reader is responsibe to fetch required information from post page. The mechanism of fetching field has comment to make the
    algorithm clean for you.
</p>
<h2>
    persistence
</h2>
<p>
    persistence module is persist posts in mongodb. This module creates a mongoclient and uses given db and collections to do its operation.
    insert_product method persists posts but before change the id field with _id because in mongodb _id is our primary_key and i want to have a general
    way to insert and update documents.
    i used update operation with upsert=True , this operation can update existed document but if document does not exist it will insert it.
</p>
